# Exercise Proxy:
- You were given the `Person` class and asked to write a `ResponsibilityPerson` proxy that does the following:
- Allows the person to drink unless they are under 18 (in which case, return "very young").
- Allows the person to drive unless they are under 16 (otherwise "too young").
- In case of drunk driving, returns "dead", regardless of age.
